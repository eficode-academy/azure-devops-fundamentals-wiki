# Managing work

## Getting an overview

Before we start doing anything it is nice to get an overview of the state of devops in your new team. Therefore we look up:

- What is our deployment frequency?
- What is our lead time?
- What is our change failure rate?
- What is our mean time to recovery?

## Finding work

Having gotten our bearings it is time to start being productive:

- What PBI should you work on?
- Can you?
- Then what should you do?
